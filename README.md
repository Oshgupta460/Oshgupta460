# Hi, I'm Osh Gupta
### Data Analytics & Machine Learning 

I bridge the gap between complex data analysis and scalable machine learning solutions. My focus is on delivering high-integrity models by prioritizing data quality, feature engineering, and automated pipelines.

###  Featured Project: Credit Risk & Leakage Prevention
**[View Repository](https://github.com/Oshgupta460/data_leakage_detection)**
* **The Insight:** Identified target leakage in a credit risk model where "future" payment data artificially inflated performance to 99% accuracy.
* **The Solution:** Developed a leakage-proof **Scikit-Learn Pipeline** that decoupled preprocessing from training, stabilizing the model at a realistic 81% accuracy.
* **Impact:** Created a production-ready framework that ensures model reliability for real-world financial decision-making.

###  What I'm Working On
* **Advanced Analytics:** Exploring deep behavioral patterns in consumer datasets using advanced SQL and Python.
* **Autonomous AI Agents:** Developing agentic workflows using LangChain and Gemini 3 Flash that can autonomously browse the web, execute Python code for data analysis, and manage long-term memory via vector stores.
